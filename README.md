# Sign-Language-Detection

## Inspiration
- In general, deaf people have difficulty expressing themselves in front of others. Natural vocal communication is not possible for them. 
- The majority of people are incapable of understanding sign language. The goal of this application is to fill the communication gap between normal people and deaf people. 

## What it does?
- The Sign Language Detection project will help deaf people while communicating. This could benefit people who are deaf or dumb, as they cannot communicate with others.
- The project is implemented for 26 English alphabets and special signs like Thief, Danger, Wish and Wait. Through the use of a webcam, a sign can be inputted into the computer, which then displays its meaning on the screen.
